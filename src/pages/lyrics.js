              <div className='song hide' id='factwithout'>
                <p>Rising waters, do your thing</p>
                <p>Take this boat that I am in</p>
                <p>Whisk me to the big ocean</p>
                <p>My little city's little sins</p>
                <p>Are adding up to equal "get me out"</p>
                <p>So river, rise up, quick and loud</p>
                <p>Cause he has found a new lover</p>
                <p>And at their wedding, I cried in my car.</p>
                <div></div>
                <p>
                  Because I can see they were meant to be But then who was I?
                </p>
                <p>
                  As they placed their rings In the back I think I had caught
                  his eye
                </p>
                <p>When his face showed nothing I heard</p>
                <div></div>
                <p>"Time, he is a friend. He's meant for healing."</p>
                <p>I can't wait til this a fact without a feeling </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Wishing for a bigger wave,</p>
                <p>I tell the water I am brave</p>
                <p>"Hey I can handle what you think I can't"</p>
                <p>"So whip me on with windy hands"</p>
                <p>But I hear "Wiser is the name of Us."</p>
                <p>"You ask for what do not trust"</p>
                <p>"So take a clock and take a seat"</p>
                <p>"And feel the wood beneath your weary feet"</p>
                <div></div>
                <p>I can see they were meant to be But then who was I?</p>
                <p>
                  As they place their rings I sit back and think "What a solid
                  guy"
                </p>
                <p>But just not mine</p>
                <div></div>
                <p>Oh, time, he is a friend, he's meant for healing</p>
                <p>I can't wait til this is a fact without a feeling</p>

                <p>I feel, I feel like such An Ifeeltoomuch</p>
                <p>I kill, I kill the love With Imrealtoomuch</p>
                <p>When I write, I write the songs That reveal too much</p>
                <p>When I lead, mislead with words To conceal my thoughts</p>
                <p>But I know no cap and that is a risky thing</p>
                <p>I blow the top up off of your ceiling</p>
                <p>This needs more complicate than needs compromise</p>
                <p>
                  I drink two drinks to get to the hazy eyes So I can't feel
                  wise, instead:
                </p>
                <div></div>
                <p>Free.</p>
                <p>The one thing that I beg to be</p>
                <p>
                  I'm bound to the ground with the rules that surround Using
                  doors under steeples each week
                </p>
                <p>Again with the big revelation</p>
                <p>But these words are my latest salvation</p>
                <p>
                  I feel that my heart has been taken by Justsayyes I can't
                  breathe
                </p>
                <p>So I leave to rediscover me</p>
                <div></div>
                <p>I sense, I sense a sense Of uncertainty</p>
                <p>I think a fraud is what they are Naming me</p>
                <p>Alert, alert, a red alert Sirens ring, 'cause if you</p>
                <p>
                  All heard my mind I know you'd Be questioning But let me
                  remain fully
                </p>
                <div></div>
                <p>Free,</p>
                <p>the one thing that I beg to be</p>
                <p>
                  I'm bound to the ground with the rules that surround Using
                  doors under steeples each week
                </p>
                <p>Finally, my faith is firm</p>
                <p>The force of a fist had to be unlearned</p>
                <p>
                  I feel that the chokehold of Blessedorburned's an ironic curse
                  I can't breathe
                </p>
                <p>So I leave to rediscover me</p>
                <div></div>
                <p>We mandate all these things that we wrote ourselves</p>
                <p>The kids my age are done with this holy hell</p>
                <p>We don't conform for simply conforming's sake</p>
                <p>
                  We're challenging a culture of Hidemistakes We all bend and
                  break from it
                </p>
                <div></div>
                <p>Free:</p>
                <p>It's the one thing that we beg to be</p>
                <p>
                  We're bound to the ground with the rules that surround Using
                  doors under steeples each week
                </p>
                <p>
                  I know it's a tough revelation But really, someone had to say
                  it
                </p>
                <p>
                  The exit is not of the wasted, we're just saying "I can't
                  breathe" "So I leave to rediscover me."

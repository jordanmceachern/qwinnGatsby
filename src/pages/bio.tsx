          Britt McQuinn (qwinn) is an award-winning Canadian East Coast
          singer/songwriter. Her early musical influences of film and video game
          soundtracks have shaped the synth-pop sound that audiences know today.
          Britt identifies as queer and a mental health advocate. She captivates
          Crowds with a magnetic, warm and engaging stage presence. She's
          opened for k.d. lang during her 25th Anniversary Ing√©nue Tour, Milk &
          Bone, Neon Dreams, and Ria Mae, between her solo act and her dark pop
          duo, bleum. She performed for the recent World Junior Hockey
          Championships. Britt participates in songwriting camps and thrives in
          the co-writing environment. Notable past camps include Music PEI
          Canadian Song Challenge and CREATE Nordic Bridges Song Camp in
          Toronto. Qwinn's song Welcome to My Life landed a sync placement
          on Netflix's Ginny & Georgia. She has songs on several Spotify
          editorial playlists, including It's a Bop, Fresh Finds Pop, New
          Music Friday Canada, and Bangers. Qwinn has label releases on Circus
          Records, Kiwi Bear Records, and Monstercat.

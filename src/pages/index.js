            Britt participates in songwriting camps and thrives in the co-writing
            environment. Notable past camps include Music PEI Canadian Song
            Challenge and CREATE Nordic Bridges Song Camp in Toronto. Qwinn&#39;s song
            Welcome to My Life landed a sync placement on Netflix&#39;s Ginny &

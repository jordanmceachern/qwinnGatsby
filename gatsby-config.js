    description: `Britt McQuinn (qwinn) is an award-winning Canadian East Coast
    singer/songwriter. Her early musical influences of film and video game
    soundtracks have shaped the synth-pop sound that audiences know today.
    Britt identifies as queer and a mental health advocate. She captivates
    Crowds with a magnetic, warm and engaging stage presence. She&#39;s opened
    for k.d. lang during her 25th Anniversary Ing√©nue Tour, Milk & Bone,
    Neon Dreams, and Ria Mae, between her solo act and her dark pop duo,
    bleum. She performed for the recent World Junior Hockey Championships.
    Britt participates in songwriting camps and thrives in the co-writing
    environment. Notable past camps include Music PEI Canadian Song
    Challenge and CREATE Nordic Bridges Song Camp in Toronto. Qwinn&#39;s song
    Welcome to My Life landed a sync placement on Netflix&#39;s Ginny &
